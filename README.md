As a data scientist, I had the opportunity to work alongside a talented team of professionals in an industry hackathon project hosted by Air Canada and BrainStation. The project's focus was on tackling a specific business challenge for their AEROPLAN platform, and our team's mission was to develop a comprehensive solution package to address this issue.

Throughout the project, we worked collaboratively to leverage our collective expertise and skill sets to generate innovative solutions that could meet the unique needs of Air Canada's AEROPLAN platform. My role as a data scientist involved conducting extensive research and analysis to identify trends and patterns that could inform our decision-making process. This is the landing page we designed:

We also implemented advanced analytics and data visualization techniques to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, which helped us identify opportunities for enhancing the platform's user experience. By combining our technical skills with our understanding of the industry and its challenges, we were able to produce a robust solution package that exceeded Air Canada's expectations. The following pages are designed for Travel and My Favourites sections:

Overall, the experience of participating in this hackathon project was incredibly rewarding. I was able to work with a team of talented professionals, learn new skills, and make a meaningful contribution to the development of a solution package that could help solve a pressing business challenge.
